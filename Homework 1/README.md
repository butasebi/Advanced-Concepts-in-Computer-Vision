Libraries required to run the project:

numpy == 1.15.4
opencv_python == 4.1.1.26

How to run each task:

ATTENTION!!! For each task, the path folders must already exist!

Task 1: 
script: TemaComputerVision.ipynb
function: task_1(input_folder_name, output_folder_name, auxiliary_items_folder_name), where input_folder_name is the path to the folder containing the images (.jpg) for task_1, output_folder_name is the path to the folder where the output files will be stored and auxiliary_items_folder_name is the path to the folder with the auxiliary resources required by the program ( the "optiuni" folder)

output: the output files for each image will be stored in output_folder_name/X_Y.txt where X will be the index of the test and Y will be the index of the photo from the test above mentioned.

Task 2: 
script: TemaComputerVision.ipynb
function: task_2(input_folder_name, output_folder_name, auxiliary_items_folder_name), where input_folder_name is the path to the folder containing the images (.jpg) for task_1, output_folder_name is the path to the folder where the output files will be stored and auxiliary_items_folder_name is the path to the folder with the auxiliary resources required by the program ( the "optiuni" folder)

output: the output files for each image will be stored in output_folder_name/X_Y.txt where X will be the index of the test and Y will be the index of the photo from the test above mentioned.

Task 3: 
script: TemaComputerVision.ipynb
function: task_3(input_folder_name, output_folder_name, auxiliary_items_folder_name), where input_folder_name is the path to the folder containing the images (.jpg) for task_1, output_folder_name is the path to the folder where the output files will be stored and auxiliary_items_folder_name is the path to the folder with the auxiliary resources required by the program ( the "optiuni" folder)

output: the output files for each image will be stored in output_folder_name/X_Y.txt where X will be the index of the test and Y will be the index of the photo from the test above mentioned.

All tasks: 
script: TemaComputerVision.ipynb
function: all_tasks(input_folder_name, output_folder_name, auxiliary_items_folder_name), where input_folder_name is the path to the folder containing the images (.jpg) for task_1, output_folder_name is the path to the folder where the output files will be stored and auxiliary_items_folder_name is the path to the folder with the auxiliary resources required by the program ( the "optiuni" folder)

output: the output files for each image will be stored in output_folder_name/X_Y.txt where X will be the index of the test and Y will be the index of the photo from the test above mentioned.
